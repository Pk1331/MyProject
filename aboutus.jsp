        <p>Sri Vallurupalli Venkata Rama Seshadri Rao was born in 1932 in Gudlavalleru to Sri Nagaiah and Smt Mahalakshmi. 

            At the age of 51, he joined Sri Adusumilli Aswardha Narayan Murthy to establish the AANM & VVRSR Educational Society, mainly to bring technical education to the reach of rural population.
            
            The Society established the AANM & VVRSR Polytechnic in Gudlavalleru in 1981 and he served the institute with such commitment and devotion, serving as an example and source of inspiration to staff and students of the institute, that in no time, the institute came to be recognized as a premier institute of Polytechnic Education and became the first choice of students seeking admission in private polytechnics through POLYCET in A.P.
            
            The Society started the AANM & VVRSR English Medium High School in 1988 to bring quality education to the reach of Gudlavalleru and its surrounding villages.
            
            The Engineering College was born out of his burning ambition to start an institute of Higher Engineering Education in Gudlavalleru, which he, with his untiring efforts had it fulfilled with the establishment of the College in 1998.
            
            He dedicated his heart and soul for the development of the college, and with the cooperation of his colleagues in the Society, Faculty, other staff and mainly with the guidance of Dr.Nageswara Rao Vallurupalli, his eldest son who was then adviser to him and presently the Chairman of the college, in no time, as was his wont, moulded it as one of the Best Private Engineering Colleges in the State.
            
            Pragmatic, sagacious, prudent, genial and of few words, he served as a role model and source of inspiration to the staff and students alike and is affectionately called 'The Father of Gudlavalleru Engineering College'.
            
            As he once observed 'Not everyone gets an opportunity to serve the cause of education and having got that opportunity, one should give one’s best to that cause'.
            
            He was the Founder Secretary and Correspondent of the Society and its Institutions right from their very inception.
            
            Founder Sri Vallurupalli Venkata Rama Seshadri Rao has been recognized posthumously with Engineering Edupreneurs Awards 2013 by ‘Engineering Watch’, a National Magazine, New Delhi, under Vice-Chancellor’s Choice for his contribution to Engineering Education in India.</p>
